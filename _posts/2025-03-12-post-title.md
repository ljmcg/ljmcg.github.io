### Introduction

I'm a senior software engineer with 25 years of experience in a wide variety of different systems. From C to C++ to C#, from SQL to NoSQL, from on-premise installations with fussy hardware integration to multi-tenant Azure cloud systems, I've done lots of different types of things. Sometimes troubleshooting an emergent problem was wildly exciting. Other times, the personal challenge of solving a hard problem elegantly was the best thing in the world.

Those 25 years were with one job -- one job that took me from a new graduate developer to an experienced Staff Software Engineer. One job with 4 different owners and a product suite that changed all around me.

But now that's past. I'm grateful for the experiences and (in hindsight) even for the greatest challenges. Next stop will be new challenges -- but I'm here now to develop my thoughts about software, design, and problem solving in a written format.

### What's next?

Eventually, next will be a new job. I'm not rushing to that, I want to put my feet under me first and stretch out a little. I want to reflect on software and on solving problems. I want to share some of what I know and what I've encountered. I want to challenge myself to tackle new and unfamiliar territory. I want to broaden my horizons, practice some skills, showcase some skills, and build some software.
